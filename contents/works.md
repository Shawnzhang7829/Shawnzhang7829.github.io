  There is currently a lack of systematic analysis on how the combined effects of urban heat islands (UHI) and heatwaves (HW) differentially impact local climate and building energy use, especially regarding cross-scale responses between building clusters and individual buildings. To address this gap, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines the Urban Canopy Model (UCM) with the Urban Building Energy Model (UBEM). The framework evaluates the influence of UHI and urban morphology on local climate conditions, building energy consumption, and design-day loads during heatwaves at both cluster and individual building scales. By incorporating localized weather data (LWD) specific to each local climate zone (LCZ), the UBEM accounts for microclimate variations in simulations. This approach provides a practical tool for bottom-up modeling of extreme climate and UHI impacts on building energy risks, while also enabling quantification of compound UHI–HW effects on urban energy use and assessment of climate resilience in building clusters with varied morphological characteristics.
