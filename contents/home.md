I am a Ph.D. graduate from Tsinghua University, focusing on the optimization of urban planning and architectural design in the context of global climate change and urban heat island effects. I am dedicated to integrating <strong>urban microclimates</strong> with <strong>urban building energy models (UBEM)</strong>, particularly optimizing models with <strong>localized climate data</strong> to address the challenges of urban energy systems and heat risk under extreme weather conditions.
